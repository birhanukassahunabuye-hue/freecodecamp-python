# FreeCodeCamp Python Journey 

This repository is a collection of practice challenges and curriculum projects completed during my Python study journey on FreeCodeCamp. It tracks my progress from basic data logic to advanced concepts.

## Featured Projects

### 1. To-Do List Manager (Final CRUD Version)
A complete task management system that handles the full data lifecycle.
- **Key Features:** - **Create:** Add new tasks with specific statuses.
  - **Read:** View all tasks or filter to see only "Pending" items.
  - **Update:** Find specific tasks and mark them as "Done."
  - **Delete:** Remove tasks entirely from the system.
- **Logic Used:** Lists of dictionaries, Boolean flags (found_any), case-insensitive string matching, and `while` loop menu systems.

### 2. Contact Book Manager
A search-based application for managing personal data.
- **Key Features:**
  - Dynamic storage of names and contact details.
  - Search functionality to retrieve specific user data.
- **Logic Used:** Python dictionaries, user-input handling, and data retrieval.

### 3. Expense Tracker (Robust Version)
A financial tool that handles numerical data and currency formatting.
- **Key Features:** CRUD logic, numerical data processing, and **Error Handling (`try/except`)** to prevent crashes.
- **Skills:** Type casting, f-string precision, and list manipulation.
### 4. Caesar Cipher (Security Tool)
A cryptography tool that encrypts and decrypts messages using a shift-based algorithm.
- **Key Features:** - Dual mode support (Encode/Decode).
  - Handles non-alphabetical characters (spaces/symbols).
  - Uses circular logic with the Modulo operator.
- **Skills:** Mathematical logic (`% 26`), function parameters, and input sanitization.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Management:** Mastering CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- **Problem Solving:** Implementing logic to filter and search through datasets.
- **User Interface:** Building interactive command-line menus.
- **Clean Code:** Using functions and proper naming conventions.
