# FreeCodeCamp Python Journey 

This repository is a collection of practice challenges and curriculum projects completed during my Python study journey on FreeCodeCamp. It tracks my progress from basic data logic to advanced concepts, specifically focusing on the transition from functional programming to **Class-based logic.**

## Featured Projects

### 1. Social Media Profile Manager (Class & State Logic)
The "Graduation Project" of my 15-part logic series, moving from simple functions to full Class structures.
- **Key Features:**
  - **Secure Login:** Authenticates users before allowing access to private methods.
  - **Privacy Gates:** Conditional logic that hides content if the account is `is_private`.
  - **State-Dependent Actions:** Users can only create posts if their `is_logged_in` status is `True`.
  - **Content Display:** An iteration engine that loops through followers and posts.
- **Logic Used:** **Classes and Objects (`self`)**, Boolean state flags, logical operators (`and`/`or`), and list iteration.



### 2. To-Do List Manager (Final CRUD Version)
A complete task management system that handles the full data lifecycle.
- **Key Features:** - **Create:** Add new tasks with specific statuses.
  - **Read:** View all tasks or filter to see only "Pending" items.
  - **Update:** Find specific tasks and mark them as "Done."
  - **Delete:** Remove tasks entirely from the system.
- **Logic Used:** Lists of dictionaries, Boolean flags (`found_any`), case-insensitive string matching, and `while` loop menu systems.

### 3. Contact Book Manager
A search-based application for managing personal data.
- **Key Features:** Dynamic storage of names and contact details.
- **Logic Used:** Python dictionaries, user-input handling, and data retrieval.

### 4. Expense Tracker (Robust Version)
A financial tool that handles numerical data and currency formatting.
- **Key Features:** CRUD logic, numerical data processing, and **Error Handling (`try/except`)** to prevent crashes.
- **Skills:** Type casting, f-string precision, and list manipulation.

### 5. Caesar Cipher (Security Tool)
A cryptography tool that encrypts and decrypts messages using a shift-based algorithm.
- **Key Features:** Dual mode support (Encode/Decode) and handling of non-alphabetical characters.
- **Skills:** Mathematical logic using the **Modulo operator (`% 26`)**, function parameters, and input sanitization.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Logic:** Mastering `__init__`, `self`, and class methods.
- **Data Management:** Mastering CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- **Security & State:** Implementing login systems and privacy toggles.
- **Problem Solving:** Implementing logic to filter and search through datasets.
- **Clean Code:** Using functions, classes, and proper naming conventions.

## Milestone Achievement
This repository documents my preparation for the **FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python Certification**, successfully mastering the logic required for the first 70 steps of the curriculum.
